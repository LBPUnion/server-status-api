# Server Status API

This is a Node.js REST API for checking the LBP server status. It's designed to be used alongside [Agent Washington](https://github.com/LBPUnion/AgentWashington), which actually monitors the servers. This API is meant to provide [LBPUnion.com](https://lbpunion.com/) with live server status updates powered by Agent Washington.
